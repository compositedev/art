## Typography

Our branding typefaces are [Sharp Sans Medium/Bold](https://sharptype.co/typefaces/sharp-sans/#features) in use as body text, and [Sharp Sans Display No. 1 Bold](https://sharptype.co/typefaces/sharp-sans-display-no1/) for headings.

Those are commercial fonts and the license doesn't allow us to distribute them. Hence you won't find them in this repository. If you're a member of the Ocean Protocol team, ask a designer to hand you the font files.

If you only need them for use on the web, you can grab them from inside the private `site` repo's [fonts folder](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/site/tree/master/public/fonts).

## Usage

It's encouraged to use this repo as a dependency within your projects to keep the assets in sync.

### Use as npm package

The whole repo is published as a npm module so just run for installation:

```bash
npm i @oceanprotocol/art
```

### Use as a submodule

 From the root of your project folder execute the following to put the submodule under `lib/art/`:

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:oceanprotocol/art.git lib/art
```

Then, from time to time, update the submodule to get latest upstream changes:

```bash
# go into submodule folder
cd ./lib/art
git checkout master
git pull
# get back to your project root
cd ../../

# or if you're a busy person, update all your submodules at once from the root of your project
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```

### Usage in JavaScript/React

Import the required assets into your project, which will return the file source path:

```js
import Logo from '@oceanprotocol/art/logo/logo.svg'

<img src={Logo} />
```

But you usually want SVG assets to be inlined for full control over styling with CSS. To achieve that, you can incorporate [svgr](https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr) into your build process to import SVG assets as actual React components:

```js
import Logo from '@oceanprotocol/art/logo/logo.svg'

<Logo className="logo" />
```

And then style away in CSS:

```css
.logo {
    fill: #141414;
    stroke: none;
}
```
