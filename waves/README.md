# The Ocean Protocol Waves

Created and designed entirely in code as SVG paths, animated with CSS by [D3.js](https://d3js.org).

The original wave used on our website can be found on CodePen, which you can use to create your own screenshots of the waves in other variations.

The assets in this repo are a recreation of those code-generated waves.
